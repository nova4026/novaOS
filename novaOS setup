unfornetly github won't let me upload the setup exe file . :(
so if you want the installer you have to download it from this link

NOTE: the windows version is a much larger file size then the .py version , if you gave pt=ython installed i would use the py, version.

windows installer is 146 mb while the py file is 7 kb. if you use the windows installer make sure you have around a gig of storage left

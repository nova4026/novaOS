unfornetly github won't let me upload the setup exe file . :(
so if you want the installer you have to download it from this link 
http://www.mediafire.com/file/duub091he2hljno/NovaOS_setup.exe/file
NOTE: the windows version is a much larger file size then the .py version , if you gave pt=ython installed i would use the py, version.
windows is 146 mb while the py file is 7 kb.
